# Simple Calculator Project

This is a Java-based console application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with user-friendly prompts and formatted outputs.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages division by zero and invalid inputs.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays results up to two decimal places for better readability.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the code.
3. Compile the program using:
   ```
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```
   java Calculator
   ```

## Example Usage
- **Input**:
  ```
  Enter first number: 6.0
  Enter second number: 5.6
  Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  Result: 33.60
  ```

## Learnings
This project was a hands-on experience to:
- Implement Java concepts like `switch` statements and input validation.
- Format outputs using the `DecimalFormat` class.
- Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., division by zero).

## Future Enhancements
- Add more operations (e.g., power, square root).
- Allow continuous calculations without restarting the program.
- Create a GUI for better user experience.
